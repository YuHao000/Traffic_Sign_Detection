# Traffic_Sign_Detection
Traffic Sign Detection from pictures using OpenCV.

Code developed for academic purposes in 2017.

This project relies on cv_lib, an own-developed OpenCv library wrapper hosted originally in [Academic_ComputerVision](https://github.com/eduherminio/Academic_ComputerVision) repo.

cv_lib header and source files are temporarily included in this project to make it ready-to-use.

# Instructions
1.  Place your pictures in samples/
2.  Run compile.sh

Currently supported traffic signs: see supported_signs/

Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 with OpenCV 3.2.0.

Feedback & PR are welcome :)
